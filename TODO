Add a Version?

currently, the versions in the base class are single versions, but they are essentially used for representing a specific line

in default_line_datas.
(and then used for titles, abd bs).

if rubygems 606 isn't solved, why not just put a total on there and let the inconsistnecies just be with some notice?

rename time_format_str_small alias

swap out gruff_builder to some other composing object of a builder, that can mash up the various velocitators?

consolidate velocitator fixtrues or at least repeatable generators in specs.

cassandra says to have an option to have the multiplexer start them from the same data (to see curve/adoption rate). I see it.

hardcode a time limit of earliest_time since historical data is not reliable.
