wtf? does a time period actually work?

## Collection

Have a grapher class that takes a collection on singular and builds the corresponding gruff? Graph.buid(coolextion) vs collection.graph

All of them have same date range max min, same line_data size

Make sure to pad 0's 

Earliest date, latest date

Most max of all 

Have a date-calc abstraction that does all the padding calculation aggregation?
