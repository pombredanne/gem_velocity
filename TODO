move VCR to an :around spec
change readme.md to have one example with different options to populate
Add an aggregate method to add #graph for a point version? (e.g, 0.n.x graph for all n versions. maybe just major, maybe minor, whatever).

web ui/embeddable links with those images.
  can't remove images
  have uniq name: hash the date_range,max,min,name,versions. (and time?)
  shard the directories of where the image goes so it doesn't bomb out?

SingleVersionsVelocitator takes versions
SingleVersionsVelocitator has a shortcut for displaying all versions in a major?
MajorVersionsVelocitator takes one major version
AllVersionsVelocitator takes no version, dispalys all stats

I want to be able to have a line be one version, or a few versions in one, mix those/not, then decide to display them in the end
  line_datas needs to be abstracted away. actually the versions concepts should be eliminated??
    so I need to have something abstract a version but it could be a few of them...
      move all the logic of changing version -> line_data into something and have that able to handle 1 or n.
