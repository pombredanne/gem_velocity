move VCR to an :around spec
change readme.md to have one example with different options to populate
Add an aggregate method to add #graph for a point version? (e.g, 0.n.x graph for all n versions. maybe just major, maybe minor, whatever).

web ui/embeddable links with those images.
  can't remove images
  have uniq name: hash the date_range,max,min,name,versions. (and time?)
  shard the directories of where the image goes so it doesn't bomb out?

SingleVersionsVelocitator takes versions
SingleVersionsVelocitator has a shortcut for displaying all versions in a major?
MajorVersionsVelocitator takes one major version
AllVersionsVelocitator takes no version, dispalys all stats

I want to be able to have a line be one version, or a few versions in one, mix those/not, then decide to display them in the end
  line_datas needs to be abstracted away. actually the versions concepts should be eliminated??
    so I need to have something abstract a version but it could be a few of them...
      move all the logic of changing version -> line_data into something and have that able to handle 1 or n.

      the only thing that it implmeents is .graph() which returns the line_data result/info whatever.
      then there's something in the middle that takes that and calls out to gruff builder.


all derived classes need to pass back to base class, so we can pass on to builder:

  line_data => title,version(s) 
  n times whatever.

  Add a Version?
