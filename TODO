rename time_format_str_small alias

consolidate velocitator fixtrues or at least repeatable generators in specs.

cassandra says to have an option to have the multiplexer start them from the same data (to see curve/adoption rate). I see it.

hardcode a time limit of earliest_time since historical data is not reliable.

speed the fuck out of it:

  b = rails, 3.2.x
  1.9.3-p392 :009 > puts Time.now ; file = b.graph; puts Time.now; puts file.inspect
  2013-10-27 17:33:54 -0700
  Wrote graph to /Users/shair/projects/gem_velocities2/gem_velocity_web/public/images/AggregatedVelocitator-rails-3.2.x.png

use the perftool stuff.
